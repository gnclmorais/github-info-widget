Github Repository Info Widget
==================

Based on the issue [#57](https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/57) of
[H5BP](https://github.com/h5bp)'s [lazyweb
requests](https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues), I hereby present
you the Github Rpository Info Widget (catchy name, I know).

Now you can quickly show an overview of a Github repository, with all the important
stats in a single and minimal place.

More features and improvements are coming. For now, check out [the demo](http://gnclmorais.github.com/github-info-widget).
